It is important to begin to understand how everyone has emotional reactions and the role emotions play in our daily lives. It is crucial that you find a balance between your multiple roles as a student, leader, and as an individual. In addition, it is a great idea to reach out and utilize the support systems in place on campus through mentoring, faculty / staff, as well as the counseling services offered on campus. Knowing what resources are available to you is the first step in helping to find that balance of emotional wellness within your life.
