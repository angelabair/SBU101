        <p data-uuid="df5ad9135bb5423c984a4fb9836d20da">Each year, a book is selected for the entire incoming class to read as part of the First-Year Reading Experience. The book is given to each freshman. Over the course of the fall semester, we engage in a dialogue about the book through a variety of events and activities—including a visit by the author on Undergraduate College Commons Day. All freshmen have the opportunity to explore this book with their peers, instructors, and the broader campus community. Ideally, you will continue this dialogue, both in and outside of your classes, and bring your own experiences and viewpoints to bear on the issues raised in the book. The University does not necessarily endorse the viewpoints expressed by the author, but discussing issues like these are an important part of higher education.</p>

        <p data-uuid="fcd0f7a7bffe4cbeadfb16688f2456b9">One of the activities centered on the book is the Creative Expressions assignment. This allows students to creatively express, through a variety of mediums, their interpretation of the book and its personal meaning. Every student in a FYS 101 class participates in the Creative Expressions contest. The purpose of the Creative Expressions Assignment is to have students reflect on and think critically about the First-Year Reader. Additionally, it creates an opportunity for students to be recognized for outstanding work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fc74694202a8430e8d7fbf0d0d559e05">Entries from each FYS 101 section will be chosen as finalists for their Undergraduate College. Of those finalists, a smaller number of students will be selected to represent their College in the Undergraduate College Commons Day contest. The winners from each Undergraduate College will receive a plaque and will be invited to have a private lunch and discussion session with the author of this year’s First-Year Reader.</p>

        <p data-uuid="930dd988d48f4053a3f0a4383e52301c">Create a project that represents your reaction to the First Year Reading. In your representation, consider how it relates to your personal, social, or academic life. You may comment on a specific chapter, theme, or on the book as a whole.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cacd167e3b544f24858377f8237eeed8">Students may choose from two categories:</p>
        <p data-uuid="daf4d4d02656432a92fbcb08ab21131b"> <b>Written Word:</b> Submissions in this category may include essays, poems, and short stories</p>
