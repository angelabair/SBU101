        <p data-uuid="a7f53c5a252945569d0267a5a81749fe">As discussed earlier, you are likely to be among the majority of people today who believe that others should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of the numerous dimensions of diversity that make up individuals. As a Stony Brook student, you have the unique opportunity to become an ally for members of our campus community who are not treated with respect.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d927a7fb09a34bfdaa38871949d1e847">An <i>ally</i> is broadly defined as a member of a dominant group who works to end oppression in his or her personal and professional life as an advocate for the oppressed population. It is important to note that an ally to any oppressed group or individual aims to serve as an open-minded friend and listener. However, an ally is not a spokesperson for the entire oppressed group. An ally is not a counselor, nor are they trained to deal with crisis situations. Rather, they connect individuals who are members of oppressed groups with support and help further their interests as they are able. An ally advocates with peers, leaders and even people in authority for fair and equitable treatment for all groups when faced with instances of injustice.</p>
