        <p class="Normal1" data-uuid="dc20dabfd58640a9a60e4a290917061f">The Stony Brook Curriculum is Stony Brook’s general education requirement. All undergraduate students at Stony Brook must complete this requirement, commonly referred to as the “SBC,” in order to graduate. Taking SBC courses, in addition to courses needed for your major or minor programs, helps to ensure you receive a well-rounded opportunity for lifelong learning at Stony Brook. If you are currently undecided about which major you would like to pursue, taking courses toward the fulfillment of the SBC is a great way to help you make that decision. Consult with your advisor or the undergraduate bulletin to learn more about courses certified for multiple requirements.</p>
