        <p data-uuid="33bb6736ee89497c843e2652d886747a">At some point in your life, you will hold a job, where you will be working with other individuals in an environment you may, or may not be familiar with. Occupational Wellness is focused on how you form those relationships while at work, and how you manage stressful or challenging situations with those individuals. Learning how to successful work with others and dealing with those circumstances are key in developing your Occupational Wellness.&#160;</p>
