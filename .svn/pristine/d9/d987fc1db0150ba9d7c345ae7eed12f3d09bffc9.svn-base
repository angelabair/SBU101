        <p data-uuid="6569139a8f3f49ffb0e3ebfeb20defc6">Stony Brook University was founded in 1957 as the State University Long Island Center. When the College opened in September of that year, there were fourteen faculty members and 148 undergraduate students. Today, the undergraduate student population has grown over one hundred times that number to over 15,500! The College was originally housed on an estate in Oyster Bay that is now Planting Fields Arboretum. Ward Melville, a local philanthropist, donated a large parcel of land in Stony Brook to the State University. In 1962, the College moved to the Stony Brook site and became the State University of New York at Stony Brook. From that moment, Stony Brook quickly grew to great stature as a premier research university both nationally and worldwide. In 2001, Stony Brook was admitted to the Association of American Universities, a group of 62 elite North American research universities founded in 1900. A number of recent studies show Stony Brook to be among the top universities in the world-based on our research and education. As we say around here, “Stony Brook is Red Hot!”</p>
        <p data-uuid="84ea0ffa24eb4666a3c24b850effe4d0">Stony Brook University is situated on Long Island’s North Shore, 60 miles east of New York City and 50 miles west of Montauk Point. Physically and academically integral to Stony Brook is its academic health center, which includes a number of schools and programs in the health professions as well as the Stony Brook University Hospital. A study published by Johns Hopkins University Press (The Rise of American Research Universities, by Hugh Graham and Nancy Diamond, 1997) places Stony Brook among the top three public research universities in the country in terms of per capita faculty research productivity. Stony Brook University Hospital has been ranked among the top 15 teaching hospitals in the country.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e0be7e7c7dc94796a8925f79ebe32499">Stony Brook is also known for its distinguished and accomplished research faculty. In October 2003, Paul Lauterbur was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his invention of nuclear magnetic resonance imagery(MRI) technology at Stony Brook, and James Glimm, Chair of the Department of Applied Mathematics, received the National Medal of Science for his work on shock wave theory. This medal is the highest civilian award bestowed by the government, and is awarded annually to about ten people. In 2005, Robert Aumann, a founder of Stony Brook’s Center for Game Theory, shared the Nobel prize in Economics, while a second Stony Brook mathematician, Dennis Sullivan, received the National Medal of Science. And as recently as the fall of 2007, four faculty members, Robert Cess, Minghua Zhang, Edmund Chang, and Marv Geller, in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science were recognized for their contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that led to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. This Nobel Peace Prize was shared with former Vice President Al Gore for their combined efforts to control global warming.
            <br />In keeping with a tradition of improving upon excellence, Stony Brook has a five-part mission:</p>
