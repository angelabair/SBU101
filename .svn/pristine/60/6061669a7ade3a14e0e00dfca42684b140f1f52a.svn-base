        <p data-uuid="ec25a37097624b6ba10563c4de472d55">Knowing about yourself is the basis for career decision-making. This process can be an exciting but scary time. But—it does not have to be scary. We challenge you to explore parts of the self-assessment process. Identify your interests by getting involved in a club/organization, part-time job/internship related to your field of interest or trying out a class of interest. Engaging in any one of these experiences will allow you to start to determine what you like and dislike—interests, your strengths and weaknesses—abilities, and what is most important to you—values.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b2fb7c8a906e4a8cbea5ddf724cc793d">Remember that the purpose of a liberal arts education, like the one you’re getting at Stony Brook, is less to give you hard job skills than to teach you how to do things like write well and think critically – transferable skills that are essential in almost any job. Because of this, every major leads to a wide variety of career options. For example, did you know that studio art majors can become doctors (if they complete the requirements for medical school)?</p>
        <p data-uuid="04fb67642f3648078474839e47a9a97f">Your major is only ONE part of what your future employer or graduate school will consider when you apply: the key is to combine your academic study with experience that adds to your skills and refines your interests.</p>
