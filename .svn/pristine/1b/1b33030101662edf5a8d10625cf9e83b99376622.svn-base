        <p data-uuid="6eaafd36335f4b48957223677495d9d1">According to the 2009 Health Assessment Survey, 23.2% of Stony Brook students reported that sleep difficulties impacted their academic performance. Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or poor quality of sleep. As a college student sleep is the first thing to go when the pressure is on. Sleep is a very important self-management tool to succeed as a student.</p>

            <li data-uuid="a80b6d125ed747bc959645b8ab649514">Due to pressures of school, family, and a social life, few students are sleeping nearly enough.</li>

        <p data-uuid="dd2f5bbff0ec4667b815037b36fe7eff">All these pressures increase stress and stress can lead to insomnia and even more sleep loss. NSF also states there are medical conditions related to sleep deprivation, depression, obesity, and accelerated aging process. Sleep is the only way to beat fatigue. It is important to recognize the signs (irritability, memory loss, illness, etc.) of being sleep-deprived and increase your sleep to diminish them. A regular bed and wake time within a sleep-conducive environment will support a good night’s sleep. Also, it is important to avoid caffeine, nicotine, and/or alcohol close to bed time.</p>
