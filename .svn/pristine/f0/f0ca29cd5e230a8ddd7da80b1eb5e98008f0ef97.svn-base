        <p data-uuid="2c04ada4c7fa4fe1a6e446a701bbf7e2">Research has shown that we all have been socialized into a world of inequality. The world that you and others around you were born into was already constructed. As you know from your studies, society is a result of a long, complicated, and often traumatic history of people belonging to different groups seeking to find their ways in the world. But often, they did so through efforts to dominate other groups. For example, the Romans sought to dominate the known world in Europe and the Middle East. The Catholics sought to dominate the Muslims through the Crusades. The Incas dominated a huge area of what is now South America, while Muslims, Manchus, and Russians, among countless others, dominated certain groups different from theirs.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1364ca54812c4302a600d7eb39264670">The Cycle of Socialization Re: Difference &amp; Inequality details the ways that we first inherit this socially constructed inequality, the impact that it has on us, and once we are made aware of this, the choices we have of whether to continue or challenge this underlying inequality. Think critically about this theory and its possible supporting evidence of past societies.</p>
