        <p data-uuid="408f42c9407746c1933c5a14d9dba459">Welcome! I am delighted that you are here for what I know will be an exciting and rewarding educational experience. Your college experiences will help to shape the rest of your life. As you no doubt know by now, Stony Brook’s faculty rank among the best in the country. We pride ourselves on providing our undergraduates opportunities to work with members of the National Academies and MacArthur Fellows, as well as over 100 recipients of the Chancellor’s and President’s Awards for Excellence in Teaching. Those of you interested in research will also have the chance to work alongside our highly regarded researchers on varied and groundbreaking projects.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="369dfc6a2ecd436ba25cef659a1f09c2"> <br />President Stanley, the faculty, and I have a strong commitment to our students. One portion of that has been the creation of the First-Year Seminar courses that help to ease your transition into university life. We trust these materials will be of great use to you throughout your time as a Stony Brook student. While you are on campus, make sure you take the time to sample all Stony Brook has to offer both in and out of the classroom.</p>
        <p data-uuid="53c00da30f5d46b4b7f0b6f23b6505e6">&#160;The Staller Center for the Arts has a full program of theatrical, musical, and artistic events that augment our formal educational opportunities. From the first day of each month all Stony Brook students with valid IDs may purchase a ticket to any Staller Center professional presentation that month at half price. Our NCAA Division I athletics and varied recreational programs infuse the campus with enthusiasm, as well as a lively spirit of competition. Your Undergraduate College will also be sponsoring activities and programs throughout the year. I urge you to get involved in the activities that interest you right from the start.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="bdfd11e1d24145d1bcbdcb1bf3d41cc8">The campus and the experiences you will have here are yours for the creating. I look forward to the energy you and your classmates will bring to Stony Brook. I wish you all the best as you embark upon this exciting journey. <br />  <br />Sincerely, <br />Charles L. Robbins <br />Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and Dean of the Undergraduate Colleges</p>
