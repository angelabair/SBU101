        <p data-uuid="23158556ddce4f9eb576b0f9deb26abd">Studying is very important in college. Your study hours may vary, but it is best to set a schedule. Once you set your class schedule, look for gaps throughout your day. It is during these gaps that you should avoid going back to your room to watch TV, hang out with friends, or take a nap.  Instead, head to your favorite study spot. This will allow you more social time after your classes are finished for the day. In college the amount of time you study usually directly correlates with what your grades become. Here are a few more differences when it comes to studying in High School vs. College:</p>
