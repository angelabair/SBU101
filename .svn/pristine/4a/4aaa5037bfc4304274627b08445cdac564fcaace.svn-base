        <p data-uuid="8eabdf13e5a54b5795829b1f72f97c5e">Stony Brook has a number of traditions that together mark the passage of the academic year. Some of these recur weekly or monthly while others occur on an annual basis.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ff702c3f8abd4e6496f83f3642cd3186">Battle of the Undergraduate Colleges</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3b524d14dac347859130eb5d159e7b36">The Battle of the Undergraduate Colleges was created in 2010 and is designed to promote and encourage Stony Brook spirit and UGC pride. Throughout the course of the academic year, there will be a series of events where each UGC will have the opportunity to earn points. The events cover a wide range of categories, including school spirit, community service, athletic and academic teamwork. Points will be awarded to each UGC based on how each team ranks in each event.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="81391478ab784f82b0fc2682f4649867">Campus Life Time</h3>
        <p data-uuid="af2e6da9521f4d5097a29db67ffb91f1">Campus Life Time takes place every Wednesday during the academic year from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm. During this time, no lectures are scheduled and many of the year’s most exciting events take place. A great time for residents and commuters alike to get involved with student life, Campus Life Time often has carnivals, student expo fairs, live entertainment, speakers, and free food and giveaways. It is a great time for students to meet up with friends and enjoy a break from the daily grind of classes.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="c7f57f7f16ac4781b99d7f2fcd47d8e4">Diversity Months</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b078f6b56dab49018fb09ceb416e50c1">Each month during the academic year is devoted to the celebration of a different aspect of our diversity: Hispanic Heritage Month (October), Diversity of Lifestyles Month (November), Diversity of Religions Month (December), Black History Month (February), Women’s History Month (March), and Asian-American Month (April). Campus clubs and organizations join faculty and staff in developing and promoting educational, cultural, recreational, and social programs that take place during each of these months.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="0cdab4df843d4c54acad307ede8e2f85">Red Hot Fridays</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c68611efd6cc484ebb855d683ed9029f">We celebrate the many achievements of our students and faculty in academics, scientific and medical research, community service, and athletics by declaring our pride with a catchy phrase; <i>Stony Brook is Red Hot!</i> To show our unity and spirit, a new campus tradition has been born; all students, faculty, and staff proudly wear Stony Brook red every Friday.</p>

        </a>
        <p data-uuid="df167df5e5714215b9c56d0e40b140f2">Stony Brook has begun a new tradition to welcome and introduce students to the Staller Center for the Arts.

        <h3 data-uuid="5948280510114c078648eecd92dddaf9">Midnights at Stony Brook</h3>
        <p data-uuid="69aa3e9cd69f4f6796d421998218e6d1">At midnight during finals week, Stony Brook students are still hopping (or screaming). Midnight Breakfasts bring thousands out to the Stony Brook Student Union to eat their favorite breakfast foods and get a second wind while studying for finals. It is a great diversion where students can laugh, socialize, and take a well-deserved break from their studying endeavors.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bbee3d6e649b436589ac8df0eb554c3c">“Midnight Screams” offer another final exam diversion. A kind of wake-up call, students all across campus who are studying for finals open their windows or step outside to let loose ear-curling screams. The camaraderie and cool air rejuvenates students and gets them motivated for a few extra hours of late-night studying.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b66111d9e0714408a5f4699621740930">“Sandy Shore”: Our Alma Mater</h3>
        <p data-uuid="63447eae5c40448397efe5a2d230eab4">The University’s First Alma Mater was written in 1962 by the founding member and head of the University’s Music Department, Isaac Nemiroff. Our current Alma Mater, Sandy Shore, was adopted in 1985 through a competition after Dr. Peter Winkler wrote the winning submission. Winkler is a professor in the Department of Music. His lyricist, Winston Clark has worked on several other compositions over the years. Carol Marburger, wife of President John Marburger, is credited as being the guiding spirit behind this alma mater.</p>
