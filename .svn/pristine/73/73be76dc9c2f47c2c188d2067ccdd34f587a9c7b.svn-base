        <p data-uuid="526be24c74b0475eb984e0bc5e61769c">As part of your UGC 101 experience, your instructor and advisor will work with you to help make choices about your Spring schedule. As you approach the end of your first semester at Stony Brook, you are probably beginning to recognize how the experiences you have had, both inside and outside the classroom, are helping you to define your interests, abilities and goals. A semester schedule that reflects your academic goals and strengths can lay the groundwork for a successful semester. Before you even begin to choose your Spring classes, it is important that you take an honest look at the experiences you have had during the Fall semester. As a starting point, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <ul data-uuid="062714927de44bd9a1846292eaa52b05">

        <p data-uuid="920ec6f8d2214811b69df3c8efd0e689">Sometimes students wait until the last minute to register for classes, but as with any process, planning a good schedule takes time and effort. Failure to plan ahead will result in your being unprepared when it comes time to register for classes, which means that you will be starting the semester on shaky ground. Academic planning is an ongoing process! You should meet with your College advisor early and often to discuss your academic goals, not only before registration, but throughout the year. Each semester will bring new challenges and successes. Your College advisor and/or 101 Instructor can help you to understand how all of these experiences can impact your academic plans.</p>

 <br />Your Degree Progress Report (DPR), located on SOLAR, will show which University requirements you have already fulfilled, as well as requirements you have yet to complete. These requirements consist of your SBCs. It will also tell you your GPA, academic major, and other information. It is recommended that you review your DPR in preparation for meeting with an Advisor.</p>

Enrollment appointments are a date and time, determined by your class status, which is determined based on credits earned prior to your first semester and courses in progress. You do not physically show up for an appointment, rather enrollment is done through the web via the SOLAR System. As long as you have access to a computer and the Internet you can enroll in classes from any location. You can continue registering any time after your appointment, up to the end of the add/drop period (See Academic Calendar, Appendix A for deadline date).</p>

<b>Credit Load</b>
 <br />The credit limit during pre-registration is 17 credits (16 credits for students in their first semester at the University). Certain programs have exceptions to these limits. This credit limit applies to all students until either the end of summer orientation or one week before the start of classes (whichever is later). At that point, the limit is raised to 19 credits.</p>

 <br />As a Stony Brook University student, you are responsible for checking your SOLAR System account on a regular basis. Whenever you see a hold on your account, be sure to read the corresponding information and follow the instructions carefully. Several weeks before the date of your enrollment appointment, you should double-check your SOLAR System account to make sure that you do not have any holds, as certain holds will prevent students from registering. For example, students who have been accepted into the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences may have a CEAS Advising hold placed on their account by their major department. Please note that students with this hold must see their major department before they will be able to register for classes. The contact information for each major department is listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin.</p>
