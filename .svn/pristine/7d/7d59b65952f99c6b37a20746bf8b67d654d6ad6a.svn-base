        <p data-uuid="f59a9c4c3eea4566b7aac67226b6a90b">The Center for Prevention and Outreach (CPO) serves the campus community by educating students, faculty, and staff on factors that place college students at risk and impact their safety. We explore the connections between emotional and psychological wellness and academic success, educate the campus community about campus resources, foster safety through the prevention of violence and the promotion of healthy relationships, and support the psycho-educational development of all students.</p>
