        <p data-uuid="29631afb8db143b1948eabb5f5119f36">Physical Wellness involves a combination of beneficial physical activity and healthy eating habits. In this section, we will highlight how both exercising and eating a balanced diet will help improve your overall physical wellness.</p>
        <p data-uuid="77c2b273edb649879a138463ded63e88">When you think of fitness, what comes to your mind? Are you thinking of loud music in an overcrowded gym, people grunting and sweating everywhere? Fitness, exercise and workouts are not all about lifting weights and sweating. Fitness comes in many shapes and sizes, and is only specific to you. Each program has many characteristics that should be carefully looked at and developed for your individual use and gain.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5d94dffe26104cb2a43cbd42bc5b4729">The Department of Campus Recreation is constantly striving to provide desired programs and services that will enhance the participant’s knowledge, interest and behaviors in order to promote healthy lifestyles and positive human relations. Through participation in recreation programs, group fitness classes, individual personal training and intramural sports, individuals can develop exercise habits, both for their time at Stony Brook University and in the years to come.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e653b43035ea409ab520e13f8843ab93">Daily exercise and fitness in general has its many benefits. Exercise releases stress and aids in relaxation, it assists with controlling your weight, decreases your risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and more. Exercise can be found in many arenas not just at the gym. Whether it is a walk around campus as opposed to taking the bus, skipping the elevator and using the stairs it comes in many different forms.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3fa2ca2b4be5459f98d7294acb8a5c10">To get a better idea where you are currently, the Department of Campus Recreation can provide you with a number of Fitness Assessments. One of the most popular is Body Composition Testing (Body Fat Testing). There are two ways to perform the test for body fat. Skin Fold Testing is one measurement that can be taken. Due to the fact that approximately one-half of our body fat is located directly under the skin we use skinfold caliper to measure subcutaneous tissue at selected sites. By pinching the skin and creating a skinfold, a percentage of body fat can be estimated. The other less invasive method is Bioelectrical Impedance Testing. Muscles, blood vessels and bones are body tissues having a high water content that conduct electricity easily. Body fat is tissue that has little electric conductivity, and by sending an extremely weak electrical current through your body we can determine the amount of fat tissue.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0ab5179e905a4fd0a88cedd489170a49">In addition, the Campus Recreation Department offers free Fitness Orientations to anyone who is looking to learn more about what the facility has to offer and how to use the equipment. Remember that we are here to help get you started on the right path and can help you with your fitness goals. To help track your goals and workouts, use the Netpulse system which is attached to every cardio machine in the building. Using your login information you can visit the website to set goals and track your workouts. Please visit stonybrook.netpulse.com for more information.</p>
