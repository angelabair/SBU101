        <p data-uuid="73cc5028d26348518680bb1c472de785">Your first year at college can be an exciting and overwhelming time. During your freshman year at Stony Brook, you will be juggling classes, sleeping, eating, socializing, and family obligations. Effective time management involves establishing a ROUTINE. You most likely had a weekly and daily routine while in high school. At Stony Brook you will have to establish your own balanced schedule and routine within the new freedoms of the college environment.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="c56eae4caee94191977ce28dad4db70e">Self-Reflection</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a4625d0585da4f638f9f6340d1e6ca09">Before classes start, you should sit down and evaluate your time management skills from high school. Keep in mind, you no longer have someone (parent, teacher, sibling) looking over your shoulder and reminding you to do your homework and or study. No one is going to reprimand you if you don’t study, attend class, or complete homework assignments. However, this will be reflected in your grades. No one is here to remind you to go to sleep early or get up for class. There will be no one to make sure you eat something before you start your day. All of this is your responsibility. Be aware of your current self-discipline and time management skills; make any changes necessary to maintain your overall wellness and achieve academic success.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="61f1dc474f0e40f7a6a0cb5e72cf26bd">Avoid Procrastination and Time Wasters</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0283184e92f64677b76bf694e8199da3">Students often procrastinate unintentionally due to environmental distractions or time wasters that prevent them from staying on track. Distractions such as Facebook, cell phones, TV, and video games are some examples of avoidable distractions that tend to lead to procrastination. You can plan time for both studying and socializing, with the priority being your studies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ea794a54e6444613b6648b4ed2015575">Kicking the procrastination habit in college may prove to be very difficult due to the many ways in which college differs from high school. Deadlines for research papers might be half of a semester away, assignments might be open-ended and vaguely defined rather than structured and clearly outlined, and the midterms for your courses may all be held within the same week. Essentially, you will be responsible for structuring your own time, and might be juggling multiple commitments, such as a part-time job, sports, or clubs.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a413bf9111494670a5fc644903892055">Make Time to be Present and Attentive in Class</h3>
        <p data-uuid="758a6463c68d414888d17f9f423b2582">Students often waste time in class by going on the internet, texting, talking, sleeping, and engaging in other unproductive activities. Because attendance is not always taken, students may be tempted to skip class altogether. These activities are not only disrespectful to the professor or instructor and decrease learning, but as outlined below they waste money too.</p>

        <p data-uuid="73c4efe5856446a6b7613daf00d4c632">Columns A and B show Stony Brook University tuition and fees during the 2013-2014 academic year based on student status. If the average student takes 15 credits in the fall and 15 credits in the spring, they paid the amount in column C per credit. If each class is an average of 3 credits, they paid the amount in column D per course. If the semester is 14 weeks long and classes meet on average 2-3 times per week, the amount in column E is what each class costs.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c380b0ef528040ebb94f2ac68212edd9">Put another way, students waste the amount in column E each time they skip a class or engage in wasteful activities during a class. Very few college students would actually throw $21-$56 in the trash, but this is essentially what you are doing when you fail to engage in class activities. This amount increases when you factor in the additional cost of books, transportation expenses, room, and meal plan.</p>
