        <p data-uuid="a0677f99cfd44520927688a80f5b146c">Safety is a key component of environmental wellness – you need to feel safe to be able to free your mind and think; to ponder and contemplate your studies. University Police is a part of that safety net but your safety is enhanced when you take responsibility for your own safety. Are you aware of your surroundings? You are in an adult environment and it is safer if you are aware and knowledgeable of your campus community.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d82f1307b4a24db69f72a2a61c1709fd">Laws, rules, and regulations are set in place with consideration of your safety and well-being. While primarily physical, there are also aspects of ethical and moral safety standards as well. How do you treat others? How do you expect to be treated by others? What is not acceptable in a given community and what is acceptable?</p>
