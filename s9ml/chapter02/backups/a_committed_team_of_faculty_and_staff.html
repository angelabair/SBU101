                <q>Coming to Stony Brook and being part of the College of Leadership and Service was an important way for me to get involved. I was very involved in extracurricular activities in high school so it was important for me to join something. I love meeting new people and enhancing my academic experiences.</q>

        <p data-uuid="7b70f6c328b04858b78ff50de60e09ce">Each incoming freshman is assigned to one of six Undergraduate Colleges: Arts, Culture, and Humanities; Global Studies; Human Development; Information and Technology Studies; Leadership and Service and Science and Society. The colleges are named for distinct themes around which academic and social life revolves; the system is intended to let students explore a wide range of interests, both within their intended majors and across the academic spectrum. The Undergraduate Colleges are small but vital communities, offering individualized support while tailoring the first-year experience for students with similar interests.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f166db87eff54181bc9e1cec4463bb55">While each College has its own personality, there are many experiences that will be the same for every first-year student.</p>

            <p data-uuid="f7843ef7c32f4d568be9c6392d6e76b9">The Faculty Director is a tenured member of Stony Brook University who provides intellectual and academic leadership for the College. The Faculty Director brings knowledge and experience in an area related to the theme of each college. The Faculty Director works closely with the Quad Director, the Undergraduate College Advisors, and other team members affiliated with each college to bring relevant courses, lectures, and social activities to students. The Faculty Director is available to meet with students one-on-one to discuss their personal interests and goals.</p>
            <h3 data-uuid="295ef0bc99fc46c8967cee5498f5e86b">Undergraduate College Advisor</h3>
            <p data-uuid="117aec5af3e04a3782accfbc5e02351b">The Undergraduate College Advisor(s) provide individual and group academic advising for first-year students on campus. Primarily, their role is to assist students with planning their academic schedules, help students make the transition into the college environment, assist students with setting goals for their future, and help students take advantage of the myriad of resources available for them on campus. The advisors also coordinate the orientation and opening programs for new students, teach and administer 101 classes, and plan events and programs.</p>
            <h3 data-uuid="038f25a9d1cb4cc9a91ff925cb4e9536">Quad Director</h3>
            <p data-uuid="a983311dedca4c268246a684190b3f74">A Quad Director (QD) within this college serves as a specialist in the area of student community development. This person strives to make lasting impressions through creative social and educational programming efforts within the residence halls. The QD directly supervises four professional staff members—Residence Hall Directors (RHDs)—that live in the halls and oversee all building concerns. The RHDs have impressionable interactions through first-year meetings to discuss reasons for attending the university and aspiring goals. In addition, they work to make their experiences more fulfilling and worthwhile. There are approximately 30 Resident Assistants (RAs) in the Quad, who live on each floor to assure quality customer service care while focusing on first-year transitional and developmental concerns.</p>
