        <p data-uuid="a63e33adadcc4e278f14fdf6d1f5b48a">What does technology mean to you? How does it affect your life, and the lives of those around you? How does information play a role in your life? How has the way people transfer, use, and create information affected our history and our society?</p>
        <p data-uuid="863a2f90f9124d91871e59cedd77615b">As you think about this, you might first focus on jobs in technology fields, on what you know about people in those occupations, or on how technology has advanced the transmission of information. You might think of engineers, who spend their time designing and building devices in response to needs. You might think of others whose occupations involve a high level of technological expertise, like information technology or IT professionals, research scientists, or computer hardware and software developers. Perhaps you recall reading about some sort of cutting-edge technological development in the news, like fuel cells, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, or robotic exploration of distant worlds. You might think about computers, cell phones, or the Internet.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dc0128c1d6d945ccb9187cc5f9915c98">But that is just a small part of the picture.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2c1ac0a70a344ae299ead27f874d77bb">Jobs in technology, advancements in science and engineering research and the impact of technological successes and failures—all these do affect our lives, and all are represented in many of the fields you may study at a major research university like Stony Brook. But let’s think about this a bit more. You may have read about those latest technological achievements on your smart phone or through a blog. Your knowledge of world events might come to you through emails or through webcasts, or even through a podcast on the device that plays music that helps you get through the day. Many of us see the world through advanced polymer lenses or eyes modified by lasers, eat food with teeth repaired through the latest dental technologies, wear clothes chemically modified on the nanoscale to resist stains, and sneakers made with “smart-materials”. Still, it’s not just the technology we use to listen to music or which we wear or drive or have implanted into our bodies to improve our quality of life that is most critical in determining how successful we are—as students or employees or as innovators and creators of the future. It is the essential role of information in our lives, and how skillfully we use the interface between technology and that information.</p>
