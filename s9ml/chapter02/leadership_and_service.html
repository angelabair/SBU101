        <p data-uuid="e427e7a4d2bd4570b4d5c6f17ef222c5">Students in the <a href="https://ucolleges.stonybrook.edu/lds">Undergraduate College of Leadership and Service (LDS)
            
        </a> are encouraged to actively explore community service and leadership. Experience in community service and strong leadership skills are central to professional and personal accomplishment. This exploration and leadership development is valuable for all students, regardless of their major(s) or area(s) of interest. By regular exposure to various leadership opportunities, students from diverse backgrounds and interests learn to meet challenges that bring about personal and social change.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bf430d26c74b47efb33df2eddc2686dd">Leadership is the ability to garner the commitment and support of others to achieve a common goal. Leadership is providing people with a sense of purpose and direction. It is convincing others to join, gaining their commitment, motivation, and willingness to exert energy to accomplish a common goal. Leaders organize peoples’ efforts around a shared vision. Leadership, by necessity, is relationship-oriented. It is how you motivate and inspire others to help a team to work together effectively. Leadership is about change and transformation. It is bringing about change within a team and/or in yourself as a leader. Leadership often requires courage and willingness to take risks. Leaders act as change agents for their community or organization. A strong leader is willing to stand up for his or her beliefs, even when they are unpopular.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6f053385ba494bb99f66b9f31fd1072e">Although some people may have natural leadership qualities, leadership is a skill that can be taught and learned. Leadership takes place in businesses, governments, nonprofit and community organizations, and in colleges. During your first year at college you will learn about your personal strengths and weaknesses while developing new skills. This is a great time to discover your own leadership skills and learn what makes a successful leader. Being involved in your college community can help foster and enhance your natural and developing talents.</p>
        <p data-uuid="27fe1830f7eb4cd5ba1d6d1c666f6e96">Service learning is about reflecting on what YOU gain from helping others. Leadership and service are often interdependent. Being involved in community service, on or off campus, teaches you about leadership and being a leader teaches you about helping others. Service learning is what you learn and gain through these endeavors. It is important to evaluate and think about the positive impact you’ve had on yourself and others directly and indirectly involved.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1cc4e8572faa4c11b9d8529243680b27">You will learn to evaluate service learning through personal growth and reflection. What changes have you made? Are you motivated to continue these efforts? How has your service been of value to others within the community? Did you promote awareness or educate others? What have you learned about yourself through this experience?</p>
