        <p data-uuid="61c162d6621c43be8c57114069f7dae3">The Undergraduate College curriculum requirements include two consecutive one-credit seminars designed to connect the new Stony Brook student to campus resources, faculty, staff and the Stony Brook community. Students will not only be engaged in academic and social activities, but will learn with faculty, staff and other students in their Undergraduate College.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="bdc15ff8f8c64cd784f2651c71ee1dc0">Freshman 101 Seminar:</h3>
        <p data-uuid="8c1918ccf5a84319ba54617d2ddb6520">In the fall and spring, each freshman is enrolled in a College-specific seminar. It is a semester-long opportunity to get acquainted with Stony Brook, taught by staff who know and understand the campus community. The course is designed to give new students the skills they need for success—both academic and social—while exploring aspects of each College’s respective themes. Some of the topics covered in the course include: study skills, test taking and test anxiety, health/well-being and success in college, academic citizenship, time management, academic and career planning, introduction to campus resources, and how to get involved on campus.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ae8e6c47c50244ceb5c520cb653f5bde">Freshman 102 Seminar:</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9bd08ca923ec4aa788b489ae510cda84">The Undergraduate College Spring Seminars are small, interactive courses designed to introduce first-year students to thought-provoking and interesting subjects. The seminars offer a unique opportunity to explore ideas, learn from peers and get to know faculty in small, intimate classroom settings. Faculty from departments across campus will instruct seminars that focus on a current intellectual interest. These topics are quite diverse and include a broad range of academic disciplines. By taking these seminars, students will learn in a small community with faculty and other students who share their interests.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f4ff1f77a0354875ba2a9fad3ca66b40">College Fellows are students who are recognized as emerging leaders in their Undergraduate College. They have distinguished themselves both academically and in their co-curricular pursuits. Through a two-semester sequence of courses, the Fellows learn to be effective peer mentors and representatives of their Undergraduate College. Qualified students may apply for this program during the fall semester of their freshman year. Those accepted will register for an Undergraduate College Fellows Seminar during the following Spring. This seminar covers four main content areas: student development theory, scholarship on mentoring and leadership development, concepts of teaching and learning, and programming and event planning. In the fall of their sophomore year, the Fellows will register for an Undergraduate College Fellows Practicum in which they will be partnered with a 101 instructor as a Teaching Assistant.</p>
