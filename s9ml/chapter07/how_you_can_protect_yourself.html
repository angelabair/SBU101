        <p data-uuid="014c598562a342af82e18d75b88d97d3">There are many steps you can take to protect yourself from being accused of academic dishonesty. Some of them seem obvious, but many of them are things students do not often consider. Take a look at the list below and become familiar with these suggestions.</p>

                <p data-uuid="0f7de650051e4f61b263b6cf6a845ddb">Prepare thoroughly for your exams, assignments and projects. This usually requires that you to do much of the work ahead of time and avoid doing work at the last minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="a25188bdc46445c0aa350739e3a28223">
                <p data-uuid="25f789df58f4447eb9650842e2c254a8">Check the syllabus of each of your courses for a section that explains academic dishonesty. There may be requirements specific to each course.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="1adb4c6fe1884f4da8a7fe80ae386f43">
                <p data-uuid="af468df6c6764418aa31770f38c7fde2">While group collaboration is encouraged or suggested, when it comes time to submitting the work, your written assignment must be your ideas in your own words, separate from the groups’.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="d65adac013934882a25523e27959de14">
                <p data-uuid="0a1289bc537d4a418381adda65892cc0">Make sure to keep your old exams, papers, homework, etc. in a safe place where friends/roommates cannot gain access to them. Also, make sure any assignments that you keep on your computer are in a password protected folder so that people who have access to your computer are unable to see these files.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="db2fdbd5d7894f609b79832b488fd318">
                <p data-uuid="5d3d2557d18344b0ab905d003f3b0bea">Some classes may require a paper that is very similar to one you previously completed, either for another class in college or in high school. Before submitting the same paper, make sure to check with your instructor that this is okay. While some professors may accept this, most will not. You must check first!</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="7bb1fe0a72b2401594335d6e57f62391">
                <p data-uuid="cbe0078f37ce495ba960aed9ed69acbf">Use a recognized handbook for instruction on citing source materials in a paper. Consult with individual faculty members or academic departments when in doubt. For example, if you are writing a paper for a Psychology course, either ask your professor how he or she wants you to cite sources in your paper, or ask the Psychology department what their preferred way of citing is.</p>

                <p data-uuid="5a87e03bc15b4c2795b6008150671d35">Many cases of plagiarism involve students improperly using internet resources. If you quote an internet source, you must cite the URL for that source in your bibliography. Copying (or closely paraphrasing) text or figures from a website without citing it and placing it in quotation marks is plagiarism. It is no different from doing the same thing with a printed source. Professing ignorance of this rule will not be accepted as a legitimate basis for appealing an accusation of academic dishonesty.</p>
