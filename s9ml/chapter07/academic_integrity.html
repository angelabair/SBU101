        <p data-uuid="1135035520444613bee26b2c0a01e418">Now that we have established the responsibility you have for your own education, let us look at an important value at the foundation of a college education: academic integrity.</p>
        <p data-uuid="628f31a420854067ac6aaf85048d972c">The concept of academic integrity implies that everyone adheres to a strict moral code regarding academic life on campus. This requires that you pursue your academic goals in an honest way that does not put you at an unfair advantage over your fellow students. You are expected to uphold the University’s rules on academic integrity in everything you do: in every paper you write, every assignment you submit, and in every test that you take.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ebde81d4276241f6aa7602bc284aad70">Sometimes students find themselves in situations in which they are tempted to disobey this code. They may have waited until the last minute to do a project, did not study for a test, forgot to do an assignment, or may just feel lazy. Please remember that none of these situations is an excuse to violate the code of academic integrity. You are ultimately the person held responsible for how you manage your academic life.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a58aead7769e4388b8c7da5b2620a4f0">Of course, there are times when even students with good intentions try to bend academic integrity rules to work in his/her favor. This is a mistake that can end up costing much more than the student had bargained for.</p>
