        <p data-uuid="58e759200c454367b2a0977381a3fde9">Excessive drinking or binge drinking has long been recognized as a major problem on college campuses. Consequences of binge drinking include lower grades, property damage, relationship difficulties, legal trouble, and even death, just to name a few.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9785ff3cac7a43c480ae11cce98bddc8">Drinking alcohol impairs judgment. Binge drinking is defined as a large consumption of alcohol per sitting that leads to physical and cognitive impairment. Currently binge drinking is having more than 5 drinks in one sitting for males and 4 or more drinks in one sitting for females. When students binge drink they increase their risk of physical injury, fighting, unwanted sexual contact, blackouts, and fatal alcohol overdose.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1f2e88fe3053409baafcd8a3664a1221">Alcohol Overdose</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0315f7f15a414b9787867575c590637a">Drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can cause depression of the central nervous system resulting in a shutdown of vital organs and possible brain damage or death.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="d01d2ea24e7c414eb3594cd364af174e">Blackouts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="ba2a0c7b57824fd79ad101107ed04173">Blackouts are when we are unable to remember events that have taken place while remaining conscious during that time. Blackouts occur when students consume enough alcohol to interfere with brain functioning. The brain can no longer form memories.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="9de72fa2d91a4c0c8718ac679fc2eca0">Tolerance</h3>
        <p data-uuid="09d370aff80d4d98a1717142d76e2a63">Tolerance is the degree to which your body has adapted to a given blood alcohol level. Each time you drink your tolerance will increase. The higher your tolerance the more alcohol you will need to drink to feel the same effects. High alcohol or other drug tolerance puts you at risk for increased health problems related to your use and at risk for developing an addiction.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e755f6f2939842d4b17194f980a9a796">Understanding Your Personal Relationship with Alcohol</h3>
        <p data-uuid="63e05d3f7d2c4170a41906616e66f8ca">We all have our own personal experience with alcohol. Whether we use alcohol ourselves or not, alcohol is a prevalent fixture in our society. Understanding our own personal feelings, beliefs, and experiences with alcohol give us a better understanding of the choices we make.</p>
