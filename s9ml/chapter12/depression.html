It is important to know it is okay to seek help. Everyone is different and can experience many levels of feeling sad to depressed. When you are unsure whether you or someone else needs help for depression, act on the side of caution, and reach out for help.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8dd1bd792fe54727ab7f59f36f357937">There is no foolproof checklist for identifying a suicidal person. Suicide, like many other human behaviors is difficult to predict. Take any talk of suicide or attempt seriously. Professional help is needed, even if you are unsure about your friend’s intentions. All suicidal behavior should be considered serious and dangerous, as it may result in permanent injury or death.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c3f38c1c2e0a4a0687e17ecbf0a6c51e">Remember that you are not responsible for your friend’s depression. Reach out to them, suggest help, be supportive, and be honest. Trying to help someone who is suicidal can be scary and make sure you get support for yourself as well. Your friend may be initially angry with you, but your actions could save a life.</p>

Suicidal feelings are intense, but the impulse will pass, especially if you talk to a close friend, a relative, or a counselor to get relief from the pain. A person who considers suicide wants the pain to end.</p>
