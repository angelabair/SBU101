        <p data-uuid="b927db5b701348d88820eb091e1f7014">It is never too early or late to develop the skills needed for Academic Success. In your experience at Stony Brook, you may find the skills you developed in high school may or may not work. Some of you may have excelled in high school with little or no effort, while many of you may have put in hours of studying just to achieve B’s &amp; C’s. No matter what your experience was in high school, all of you will be challenged when it comes to goal setting, study skills, note taking, and most importantly, time management.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="9d58930a06ad42b589daa4ba1c970bc8">Goal Setting</h3>
        <p data-uuid="26edc63a25064e2ca346597a46a6b618">Why did you come to Stony Brook University? Millions of students go to college every year and their reasons for going are as diverse as their backgrounds. It is important for you to think about why you came to college and start to set goals. By setting goals, you are programming yourself for success.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1ccc4b10514c47dc9c5eb98aee933c8c">What are your own goals for your academic and personal life? Utilize your 101 instructor, your TA, other chapters in this book, or your peers to make sure you are including all important aspects of college student life when answering these questions. Take some time to write out your goals and put them in a place where you will see them on a daily basis.</p>
        <ul data-uuid="b8e0feeb71794ad2a966861434f75deb">
            <li data-uuid="aee519f061024562a5f3fa814d96fdfc">What are your <b>academic</b> goals that you would like to meet by the <b>end of this week</b>?</li>

        <h3 data-uuid="e103df23d13d44edb563c28e16047338">Read your Course Syllabus</h3>
        <p data-uuid="495e7ce329a34c1997f8d2d9f8ea4c56">Your syllabus provides you with a lot of important information that you will need to know for your course. You should read each of them over very carefully so you’ll know exactly what to expect for the semester. Here are some important things to look for:</p>
        <ol data-uuid="9085aa1be29142b9a7f5e8f29424196a">
            <li data-uuid="5602b25855df4f0eb545369471f26e52">Your professor’s information and how they prefer to be contacted if you have a question.</li>
            <li data-uuid="5a6ec22d9cae4136822a001b5f531f58">The expectations the professor has for the class. For example, some professors do not want students to bring laptops to class to take notes, some have strict policies regarding cell phones and MP3 players, and some have rules about eating in class. It is important to read these over carefully.</li>
            <li data-uuid="502e6136546844a2bf64af5cfffc8451">Days that the class will be meeting in a different location so you do not end up being late those days by going to the wrong place.</li>
            <li data-uuid="2333db139be74c16b877c31bae603982">The dates of exams and due dates for homework assignments. Many college professors do not remind you that tests and/or assignments are coming up since they expect you to be reading the syllabus.</li>
            <li data-uuid="cb6901b5024b4f8395c2a01af656f534">Grading policies such as how much each test/quiz/assignment/project is worth so you’ll know exactly where to focus your attention. Additionally, look to see if there are any extra credit opportunities, what the policy is for attendance and class participation, if the lowest test grade is dropped, and what the penalties are for turning in assignments late.</li>
