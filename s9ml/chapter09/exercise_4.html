        <p data-uuid="af008ccb2fd34deeabb78fa2987c6d75">In the diagram below, fill in the items that you had starred in the previous three sections (you may have more than three per category). Looking at the lists, complete the overlapping section of the circles with ideas you have for possible majors/career fields. Be as specific as you are able (you could list “something with animals” or “greyhound dog rehabilitator”). Talk to your advisor about your ideas. Having trouble putting it all together? Your advisor can help with that too!</p>
