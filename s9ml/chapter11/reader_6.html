While here at Stony Brook, you will be engaging in academic programs that will promote growth of ideas and knowledge that you can share and experience with others. Your intellectual wellness will be improved through actively learning, experiencing new things, sharing creative ideas and engaging in your studies. Though it is important to share and discuss with others while you learn, it is important to remember academic integrity and being honest about where an idea or thought originated from. It is healthy to share ideas, but making sure the proper individuals are recognized for their work is critical.</p>
