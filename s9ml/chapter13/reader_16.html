        <p data-uuid="51e67f352e454e9fb4c7eb12bfee971a">Blackboard is a web-based course management system that allows Stony Brook instructors to post course information, collect assignments, and administer quizzes and group projects.

        <p data-uuid="dbd8a89a7e784227af6703c3e0ed35cb">When you send an email from Blackboard, your name is not displayed. The recipient only sees the email address. It is important to sign your name at the bottom of any message you send. If an instructor tells you to refrain from sending emails and encourages you to visit during office hours, students should respect those wishes. While email is a popular communication tool among students, several instructors prefer to meet with students in person, especially in large classes.</p>
