        <p data-uuid="4b20eccf7aff4948a0e6c8a1b093d841">The term peer-reviewed refers to the rigorous review process that an article goes through before being accepted for publication in a scholarly journal. The steps go something like this:</p>
        <ul data-uuid="53e03257c6354130826f455517e23304">
            <li data-uuid="06d39df5e8ce492b83bb6c09139d147d">An author submits an article for publication.</li>
            <li data-uuid="c547b77268a4415e9e331e77fd272247">It is reviewed by scholars who have expertise in the subject area.</li>
            <li data-uuid="6a34a3e0138247448cd49f3b2d416ff5">Many corrections and suggestions are made to the article, or the article is rejected.</li>
            <li data-uuid="d49e9077113c4c19a8c7ddae2f0a8025">The author needs to incorporate the corrections and suggestions before the article is accepted.</li>
            <li data-uuid="98a1cc9daa894166947b8390a2a91cc1">The author usually has to go through this cycle several times before the article is accepted.</li>
