        <p data-uuid="f2f6d271d83e4b379f41dc641c7fd233">The first year of college is a time of excitement, transition, and perhaps some apprehension. This course is designed to help you discover all that Stony Brook has to offer and make a seamless transition to University life. Each week, you will have the opportunity to discuss important topics that are essential to your success with your peers in your Undergraduate College. Your instructor will be an important resource as you learn practical policy information, as well as develop foundational skills that will serve you through your academic career.</p>
        <p data-uuid="47eeb36b6ae64d72b4e53f5ece05acf2">We have created this course and textbook to directly support the factors that help students succeed: effective study and test taking habits, good relationships with faculty and fellow students, critical thinking skills, communication skills, involvement outside the classroom and many others. There are many resources available to you as you navigate your first year at Stony Brook, and this textbook highlights many of them. I encourage you to take full advantage of what this course offers and participate in class discussions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d8b1aae48509447697f08273ec834058">I wish you great personal and academic success this year. Welcome to Stony Brook!</p>Sincerely,
        <br />Jean Peden
        <br />Assistant Dean and Director of the Undergraduate Colleges.</body>
