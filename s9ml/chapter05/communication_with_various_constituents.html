        <p data-uuid="033d8b883125415583463e92647e6778">Stony Brook University uses many ways for communicating with students; however, almost all communication that the university sends to students is “paperless,” meaning that it will be sent via e-mail, SOLAR or Blackboard. You are responsible for checking your accounts on a regular basis. If you live in the residence halls, you may also receive information on bulletin boards, in your mailbox, and from your RA/RHD. Stony Brook University also requires students to use their Stony Brook email addresses as their primary email address. If you choose to use a different email address, you must arrange to have messages forwarded from your school address. Students who fail to check and respond to these items by the designated deadline can have severe consequences, including increased tuition bills, loss of financial aid, deregistration from classes, loss of health insurance coverage, or loss of campus housing. Below are some examples of problems students have had when they fail to respond to notices from University administration:</p>

Staff members are here to help you and treat you with respect, although it is expected that you will also be respectful of them and the policies they are required to enforce. If you are not sure where to go to resolve a problem, your Undergraduate College Advisor is usually a good place to start.</p>

        <p data-uuid="07209ed303cd4242b3a2ffbf72ca87c7">Communication dynamics between students and their parents, guardians, or other involved family members change significantly during the college experience. As a college student, you are ultimately responsible for your own college career, and the responsibility to communicate with others and advocate for yourself to achieve academic success lies with you - the student, not with parents or other individuals such as teachers or administrators.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f8781c3eeb9042d193eb6377e0f78e7c">This means that the university may give information to the student, and the student has the responsibility to pass that information on to the parent. Parents may provide information to students that should be passed on to the administration. Parents and university administrators rarely communicate directly with one another. The student is the center of the communication model and communication flows through the student.</p>

        <p data-uuid="1a4b6f8268d6482d8b008a2dc8118644">Although your parents may have helped you apply to college, complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and pay your college expenses, your college education is your responsibility. Parents do not have access to SOLAR, Blackboard or your email unless you have given them access to your account. It is your responsibility to make sure they are aware of items and deadlines such as bills or health insurance information when relevant.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ab3dd4112646436ca4931139ff96f73e">Some students feel that giving their parents access to their accounts is “easier”; however, this philosophy has three potential problems:</p>

        </ol>
        <p data-uuid="0897dceb8c7547c0b8dbb8867e1136bb">Most disciplinary records at the college level are not shared with parents. Depending on the severity of the incident and the risk to the student or others, parents may be notified at the discretion of university officials.</p>
        <p data-uuid="03db20d11d4e438e8bc1f4d748109e9d">Despite the fact that parents are not notified, Stony Brook encourages open communication between students and parents. Many parents are “investing” in their student’s college education and deserve to know how this investment is helping their child to grow and develop. Parents often express shock and dismay that they are only informed of issues that their student is having after it is too late to help. Parents generally want to help and support their children. Communicating with parents provides them the opportunity to offer support, yet also allows students to exercise independence and practice responsibility while alleviating some fear and stress that can often be associated with these new situations.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b8ac7459660540a2aebf27b3f0752acd">Students who fail to communicate regularly with parents may face circumstances that will likely need to be explained to them eventually, including:</p>

        <p data-uuid="f4366bc6d3bb4c0fab3827ce8d9252b9">Remember that your education is your responsibility, but parents can help to support, encourage, and direct you throughout the experience.

        <h3 data-uuid="275b9c10ed3c49b58ec8f30b4f0b8a0e">Communication with Faculty</h3>
        <p data-uuid="bd7435979b434221b9e361ee3446c78b">One of the greatest differences from high school that students will experience in college is communication with University faculty. As you read in the Academic Success chapter, it is your responsibility to communicate with faculty both in and out of class. This may be intimidating at first in a large lecture classes, but faculty and teaching assistants are available to help you as long as you communicate with them appropriately and in a timely manner.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bb097e6808204f9a8fd29df65dd647ab">First and foremost, be sure to read your syllabus. If you are going to see your professor, make sure to visit them during the office hours they have provided. It is also a good idea to let your professor know ahead of time that you are planning to stop by and what it is specifically you need help with. This will allow them to prepare ahead of time when possible.</p>
        <p data-uuid="41163e51b75d4a238dec64d651676877">Make sure to address your professor by the appropriate title. The syllabus will indicate if they have their PhD, M.D., EdD, PsyD, etc. If they do have one of these degrees, you should address them as Doctor, but when in doubt use the title Professor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="13a04b8158ad4cd8a6ca49bda954d933">Be honest with your professor; they get frustrated when students are not being truthful. Professors may be more empathetic if you admit that you forgot the assignment at home and will be sure to send it to them as soon as possible.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f9f86177c44b452e9482214497225ee4">If you have to miss class, make sure to discuss this with your professor ahead of time. If you are sick, be sure to email the professor and bring any necessary documentation such as a doctor’s note to the next class session. Remember, you are responsible for making up any work you missed so be sure to follow up to get the assignment.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4a3d6a6d839943019e14440dc3556b99">The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) conducted a survey of over 450 employers in 2002 and asked them the most important things they are looking for in perspective employees (Coplin, 2003). The most important skill cited by employers was Communication Skills (verbal and written). Among the top five were (1) communication skills, (2) honesty/integrity, (3) teamwork (works well with others), (4) interpersonal skills (relates well to others), and (5) strong work ethic (Coplin, 2003). Teamwork and interpersonal skills also strongly relate to one’s communication skills.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a7873f361f29419dbb949a902a3019cd">Do you want to know how important GPA was to employers? It ranked #17 (Coplin, 2003). This is not to state that your GPA is not important; it certainly is, especially if you plan on attending graduate school after Stony Brook. However, your communication skills may prove to be more valuable in the workplace, as well as during internships and volunteer work and in leadership roles you assume throughout your life.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ac8e59eca15a4da88519e337b713d8d3">It is usually fairly simple for students to understand how poor communication skills may cause difficulties with employers:</p>

Students come from different ethnic, religious, cultural, and geographic backgrounds, many of which have communication norms and styles with which students may not be familiar. Students should be sensitive to differences when communicating with peers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f38e913071244b27acd6a13cf2ba1f6b">Students may (advertently or inadvertently) cause harm to others or themselves by not carefully considering their communication. For example:</p>
        <ul data-uuid="a687fd799b5747a8a18ddae0c9ab74dd">
            <li data-uuid="c5daf86aa1cb4e89acfb26779209ec10">
                <p data-uuid="3d55994cd65f4de29b87ba65bffc490d">In high school, a student regularly used a derogatory saying (i.e. “that’s gay” or “that’s retarded”) around his peers. Upon using the same saying in college, he is told by a new friend that they find the saying insulting, hurtful, and bigoted.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="a465b0b969cd4b09834ba73fdc2bf4f2">
                <p data-uuid="6cb96f844e474052afcdf74ff4d007f2">In working with a classmate on a project, a student uses profanity via e-mail to voice her frustration with the assignment. The classmate forwards the email to the professor, stating that they find the student’s behavior inappropriate and disrespectful.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="aeb356bddfa74138b96c0265a4338a5c">
                <p data-uuid="a4eb3a0cb7dd4e55926087134b6b54ba">A student has a new roommate who is disrespectful of the student’s space and possessions. In high school, the student never spoke up for themselves when someone bothered them because they felt it wasn’t worth it. The roommate’s behavior is getting worse and the student is becoming unhappy living at college. People have different ways of approaching and responding to conflict, which was learned from examples around them while growing up. Communication is improved when both parties have the ability to speak and be heard. Ineffective or unhealthy communication can contribute to conflict. Criticism, defensiveness, and disrespect are aspects of unhealthy communication, and conflict becomes personal and destructive. Conflict is a natural part of life, and when dealt with constructively, can contribute to growth. When communication is healthy and effective, it is positive and respectful, and conflict is resolved with compromise and humor. <i>Conflict resolution skills</i> are communication strategies that can help avoid or de-escalate conflict between students.</p>

        <p data-uuid="dd5a62a0619c47f39dfdc624cf050850">Here are some basic ways of approaching conflict constructively:</p>
        <ul data-uuid="4b3c30c7eb054f24b2d812c7f72cdef1">
            <li data-uuid="08dc7ee5b05c49ed81e697a80c644fe5">Stay calm</li>
            <li data-uuid="4316edb230ad43d39a7edc08bbea427c">Clearly express feelings or concerns (Using “I” statements: “I’m upset because…”)</li>
            <li data-uuid="06e215c2724a4767a6f0c3fcc535c7bc">Be specific; deal with one issue at a time</li>
            <li data-uuid="4ce7d14edc7342f7897e178d2d703353">No personal attacks or accusations</li>
            <li data-uuid="8237d70eefe145628bc07aceeaabf868">No generalizations or exaggerations</li>
            <li data-uuid="00908e0a032b4f2c81bd1f9abf5cf622">Don’t withdraw or deliver ‘the silent treatment’</li>
            <li data-uuid="0db7e57f07e74e2fb315db36aec134ac">No violence, or threats of violence</li>
        </ul>
        <p data-uuid="ab3226ea8383475a93e964c79743165f">If conflict or interpersonal violence is an issue in your life, support is available. Contact CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) for help, located on the 2nd floor of Student Health Services or via phone (631) 632 – 6720.</p>
        <p data-uuid="086dc4f6fe9a4b73963c24ca8279d723">Students may find that they need to change their communication style in college in order to be successful. For example, a student who was shy in high school might have to be more outgoing in their residence hall or in classes. A student who was very talkative in high school might have to start listening more in order to form good friendships.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b9121c9490bf43179e53041b5ef6e9c7">Students can take positive steps to improve their communication with peers by remembering the following:</p>
        <ul data-uuid="4e0a953ec4cb4a5d989c31cfa5ff4b62">
            <li data-uuid="d18f48340c974bc7bee4db68a2670bdc">
                <p data-uuid="632b5694e7714d6283c19906e5e58fa6">Look for opportunities to <b>learn about diversity and differences on our campus</b>. You may learn about new ways to communicate, new cultures, and new traditions. Your understanding of these differences will help you communicate with diverse audiences on campus and beyond.</p>
            </li>
            <li data-uuid="d821be15e1104837a6740d236aff80b5">
                <p data-uuid="1e8ba349f2f440bab697371b7598501f"><b>Be aware of your online presence</b>. Many students are far too liberal with the information and photos that they post on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media websites. Remember that you are judged by your online presence, as well as your in-person presence. Your words and actions should be consistent in both arenas. Hurting or insulting someone online is the same as doing so in person. Online communication lasts forever, and is open to the whole world to see (regardless of how strong your think your privacy settings are); make sure you are sending a positive message.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p data-uuid="cb54f8d6919a49279ec54ab9f009119d">In summary, remember that your communication skills will make a <b>lasting impression</b> on the people you meet. Leave them with a positive impression of you.</p>
