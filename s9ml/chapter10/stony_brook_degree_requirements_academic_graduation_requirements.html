        <p class="Normal1" data-uuid="dc20dabfd58640a9a60e4a290917061f">Stony Brook University, like many American universities, has a liberal arts curriculum. This means that you need to take a few courses as part of your general education requirements that expose you to a wide variety of subjects so that you develop into a well-rounded individual.</p>
        <p class="Normal1" data-uuid="79005f2c3844413eae2e38f552bb80db">While you will specialize by selecting one or more major areas of study and perhaps also a minor, the goal of your Stony Brook education is for you to have a broad range of skills and experiences that will prepare you for whatever career or life path you choose to pursue.</p>
        <p class="Normal1" data-uuid="f69f567dbb4a45dea872943722cbf21e">We want you to be a leader in that field. At Stony Brook, we recognize that the best scientists are inspired by art and literature, and the best artists and business-people are informed by trends in science and technology.</p>
        <p class="Normal1" data-uuid="2250ac242f0544a1898f414ea8bad4ef">The Stony Brook Curriculum is our version of general education. Over the course of your four years at Stony Brook no matter what you major in, you will need to fulfill a series of objectives that will help you develop the broad range of skills and experiences you need to be a successful individual. The come in 4 big categories: "Demonstrate Versatility", "Explore Interconnectedness," "Pursue Deeper Understanding," and "Prepare for Life-Long Learning".</p>
