        <h3 data-uuid="cde3e93fc40d4fb29559db787446cffb">Registering for Courses that Require Permission</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a868ca474dbf43bcb59ed2fef633e313">Permission is required if the course is restricted to certain students or if the instructor/department is keeping a manual waitlist. You should contact the department to receive permission to register. Once permission is granted, you’ll receive notification via a SOLAR message that you can register for the course. Permissions have an expiration date (this will be noted in the message) so be sure to register before the permission expires.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="050ac2b218af4bd89c2e1b1927cf632e">Reserves</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3d8d365fdc04460d811531d03619c707">Some courses have the remark: “Some seats reserved for . . . ,” noted in the Class Details view. Departments may reserve seats in courses for students in their majors or for seniors, among others. When you search for a course in the SOLAR System, although it may appear open, you may not be able to register because the only remaining open seats are reserved for other students.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="6d973dc423964027a6d8a27067d3af3a">Enforcement of Prerequisites</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9f4f6e1308eb45ea8d81097b016275cc">Policies on prerequisites differ by department; in some cases, you will not be permitted to register unless you have satisfied the prerequisite (the SOLAR System will check to ensure completion of the prerequisite). If you believe you have satisfied the prerequisite by a transferred course, you may have to provide proof of this to the department before you’ll be permitted to register.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9a5ca70cdf924a90ad0faf575d3020d4">Instructors have the option to deregister you if you do not have the proper prerequisites. If you want to take a course but have not completed the prerequisites, you should speak to the department offering the course.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="70af8d27c23046f99950f23f77e8dd75">Course Re-Take Policy</h3>
        <p data-uuid="1a9e4ad235f040deb76c7bb15e279465">Any undergraduate who wishes to repeat a Stony Brook course that is not designated as repeatable must obtain permission from his or her academic advisor. This policy applies to all current and previously taken Stony Brook courses. If you are seeking re-enrollment in a class in which you earned a grade or remark on the academic transcript (including, for example, grades of A–F, S, U, W, P, NC) on the first attempt, it is considered a course repeat. Students are not permitted to select the graded/pass/no credit (G/P/NC) option for repeated classes. Should you need to request permission to repeat a course, please speak to your college advisor. For additional information, please visit: <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/advising/retakeinfosheet.shtml">http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/advising/retakeinfosheet.shtml</a>
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="cbe1e3d7f6da40e593488c0c6b4d2962"> <br />Students wishing to take a course more than twice must submit a petition to the appropriate committee on academic standing and appeals. In support of this petition form, students must include written approval from the undergraduate program director of the department offering the course. <br />  <br />Credits for retaken courses will count once toward cumulative credits, but will count each time toward semester load. Each grade received in the course will be averaged into the cumulative grade point average. A re-take grade does not replace the original grade. <br />  <br />Students wishing to re-take courses should consider doing so in the summer and winter sessions, if possible, as their registration opportunities in fall or spring semesters may be limited. Although students are permitted to register for a second attempt of any course in summer or winter without written permission, it is expected that they will consult with an academic advisor. <br />  <br />Students registering for ‘High Demand/Controlled Access Courses’&#160;(HD/CA) for the first time will have priority to do so. Students wishing to take an HD/CA course for a second time must meet with an academic advisor to request permission. If permission is granted, and if seats remain available, students will have the opportunity to register after all students taking the course for the first time have been accommodated. Alternatively, students may retake HD/CA courses during the summer or winter sessions without priority limitations, or may take an equivalent course at another institution. Students seeking to take courses at other institutions should seek pre-approval from the relevant department at Stony Brook and file a Transfer Course Evaluation Form with the Transfer Office. All other aspects of the course retake policy (as detailed in items 1-7) remain in effect for HD/CA courses.</p>
