        <p data-uuid="3ec93df34c2047cf9ed5759f5d85a469">Every semester, as well as Summer and Winter sessions, the University Registrar’s Office produces an Academic Calendar for the current term. This calendar contains information about many important dates and deadlines, such as the last day to add or drop a course and dates that classes are not in session. It is extremely important for you to become familiar with the calendar so that you never miss an important deadline.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f83524740f4841bab80fe6bdb128d4ee">The Academic Calendar is accessible on the Registrar’s Office webpage:
            <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/registrar/" class="link-inline">http://www.stonybrook.edu/registrar/</a>
            or via link from the SOLAR System. If you have any questions about how to read the Calendar, you should consult with your Undergraduate College Advisor.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="7de06e080f384277b9f578a25c4a93b3">The Add/Drop Deadline</h3>
        <p data-uuid="773cf90063f146bb9b9b805d08901c7c">Students are expected to finalize their class schedules by the end of the “Add/Drop” period, which normally ends at the end of the second week of classes during the Fall or Spring semester. The Add/Drop period is shorter during the Summer and Winter Sessions, so always consult the Academic Calendar for the official deadline. Failure to finalize your course registration by the end of the Add/Drop period may have significant consequences; therefore you should always consult with your Undergraduate College Advisor prior to the Add/Drop deadline if you are having trouble completing your schedule.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="71680e7a6aa84dabb95e31c7691043c0">Graded/Pass/No Credit Option (G/P/NC)</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9d26e4d518a74dcea33722fd6db18940">There are a number of different ways that a course may be graded. Most courses are letter graded, A–F, while some are graded S or U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory). Among the few other variations that exist is an option that the student can select called G/P/NC or Graded/Pass/No Credit. This option, accessible via the SOLAR System, must be selected by the end of the 9th week of classes during the Fall or Spring semester (again consult the appropriate Academic Calendar for the exact date). It is always wisest to discuss the G/P/NC grading option with your Undergraduate College Advisor before making your final choice on SOLAR.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8d43bd24a77942c6a82ad70b432e6be2">
            <b>How does the G/P/NC Option Work?</b>
            <br />
            Students will be permitted to select G/P/NC for a course via SOLAR and indicate a minimum grade they wish to earn and have recorded on the transcript. So, for example, if a student selects G/P/NC for ECO 108 and indicates a minimum grade of B, if the student earns a grade of B or higher in the course, that grade (B, B+, A-, or A) will appear on the transcript. If the student earns a grade less than B, but at least a D, then a P will appear on the transcript. If the student earns an F, then an NC will appear on the transcript.</p>

If a student should achieve his/her minimum grade or higher, the achieved grade will be the final reported grade on the transcript and will be factored into the GPA. If a student should achieve a grade less than the threshold but higher than F, the final reported grade on the transcript will be P (Pass). If a student fails the course, the final reported grade on the transcript will be NC (No Credit).</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="9db8f9e785f0438ebf2a246c40a3bbe8">Withdrawing from One or More Courses</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3ebf2e835eef4a5192959d5bafd109e6">Dropping a course after the end of the Add/Drop period is considered an official “withdrawal” from the course. Like the G/P/NC, this option must be chosen by the end of the 9th week of classes. Again, it is wisest to choose to withdraw from a course only after thoroughly discussing this option with your College Advisor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="651446b730e6431db45efbf0b8acdf4b"><b>How does the Withdrawal Option Work?</b>
            <br />
            If a student chooses to withdraw from a course, they are no longer required to attend that course. As soon as the student withdraws from the course, a “W” is recorded as the student’s final grade on the transcript.</p>

        <p data-uuid="35f6425bd38a426e8c386c7ad5e0803d"><b>Is It Better to G/P/NC a Course or Withdraw from a Course?</b>
            <br />
            Whether it is wiser to select the Graded/Pass/No Credit or Withdrawal option (or neither of the two) is dependent on many factors. The best decision you can make is to meet with your Undergraduate College Advisor prior to choosing either option to talk about which option may be best for you.</p>
